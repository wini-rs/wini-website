# wini-website

*The following commands are compatible with `just`, so you can also use `just` instead of `wini`*

## Start

To enter the development environment: 
```sh
wini env # This requires Nix
```

To run the project:
```sh
wini run # By default, starts on port 3000
```

After that, you can see the project by looking at `localhost:3000`, from your browser or in CLI (`curl localhost:3000`) !


## Creating a new page

To create a new page:
```sh
wini new page
```

After that you can edit `./src/server.rs` to add
```rs
.route("/your-page", get(pages::your_page::render))
```


## Deploy

You can run your application in production by doing:
```sh
wini run-prod
```


## How to do ... ?

Wini commands are just based on `just`, so you can look at `./justfile` to see what is run behind the hood, and you can customize it as you wish!

Or you can do 
```sh
wini -h
# or
wini help
# or
just -l
```
for a quick recap
